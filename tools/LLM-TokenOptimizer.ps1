.SYNOPSIS
    LLM-TokenOptimizer - Production Quality v4.0
.DESCRIPTION
    Self-bootstrapping launcher that verifies the environment, installs
    dependencies, generates Graphify graphs, and launches Claude Code reliably
    on any Windows 10/11 PC. References itself as LLM-TokenOptimizer throughout.

    v4.0 - three changes:

    1) MULTI-WINDOW. The launcher no longer runs one project at a time behind a
       global single-instance mutex. You now pick a MASTER FOLDER once (the
       parent directory that holds your projects); the launcher lists the
       subfolders inside it and you choose which ones to open. Each chosen
       subfolder gets its own independent console window running its own
       Graphify extraction and its own Claude Code session, and they all run
       at the same time. The launcher window stays open as a control panel so
       you can open more project windows whenever you want. The instance lock
       is now per-project (two windows on the SAME folder is still blocked -
       they would fight over the same .graphify output), and config.json is
       written with a cross-process lock + merge so concurrent windows don't
       clobber each other's project history.

    2) SETUP IS REMEMBERED. Previous versions re-ran the OmniRoute onboarding
       (API key prompt, "open the dashboard and connect Claude Code") on
       basically every launch, because the only connectivity probe was
       `omniroute providers list --json` and any failure of that command read
       as "not connected". Now the saved API key is validated against
       OmniRoute's own /v1/models endpoint, a rejected key (401/403) is the
       ONLY thing that triggers a re-prompt, an unreachable server never
       discards a good key, and once the Claude provider has been seen working
       the result is recorded in config.json and never asked about again.
       Use -ReconfigureOmniRoute to deliberately redo that setup.

    3) 1M-CONTEXT MODELS, DISTINCT FROM THE DEFAULTS. Claude Opus 5 and Claude
       Sonnet 5 both carry a 1M-token context window as BOTH the default and
       the maximum - per Anthropic's model docs there is no smaller context
       variant and no separate "1m" model ID for either one, so the old
       `claude-sonnet-5(?!.*1m)` exclusion was filtering for something that
       does not exist. Model resolution now reads OmniRoute's live /v1/models
       catalog, prefers the `cc/` (Claude Code OAuth) provider prefix that
       OmniRoute documents for Claude-family models, and accepts an entry only
       when the catalog agrees it carries a >=1M context window (or is a
       -5 model, which is 1M by definition). Claude Code's auto-compaction
       window and output cap are raised to match, otherwise the client
       compacts at ~190k and the 1M window goes unused. The two entries are
       pinned to their resolved OmniRoute catalog IDs and labelled
       "Opus 5 - 1M - OmniRoute" / "Sonnet 5 - 1M - OmniRoute" so they are
       visibly distinct from Claude Code's built-in defaults, and
       availableModels is restricted to exactly those two.

    v3.1: fixed the Graphify output path for Graphify 0.17.1+, which now
    writes to a hidden .graphify\graph.json (not graphify-out\graph.json) and
    auto-generates the HTML studio during `extract` itself.

    v3.0: pxpipe removed entirely; Claude Code routes through OmniRoute, which
    applies its own compression pipeline (RTK -> Caveman -> LLMLingua -> Lite).

    v4.0.1 - bug-fix pass:
    - 'm' (open the master folder itself) could go unreachable: a master
      folder with zero project subfolders bounced you straight back to the
      "pick a master folder" prompt before you ever saw the picker menu that
      the 'm' key lives on. The picker now always shows, even with an empty
      list.
    - New 'n' key in the picker: creates a new folder directly inside the
      master folder, which then shows up as a numbered project on the next
      refresh.
    - Empty folders (freshly created, or an empty git clone target) are now
      valid projects. Test-ProjectDirectory / Test-MasterFolder used to
      hard-reject anything with zero files in it.
    - Install-Graphify was called in two places but never defined anywhere
      in the script - any machine without Graphify already on PATH (i.e.
      every clean install) hit an undefined-function error and stopped dead.
      Added a real implementation (pip install, with a --user fallback and a
      PATH refresh so it's usable immediately without reopening the shell).
    - Test-GraphifyVersion called Get-GraphifyCommand, which also didn't
      exist anywhere - this ran on every single launch and would have
      crashed the launcher window immediately. Fixed to call graphify
      directly, same as the rest of the Graphify functions.
    - Removed ~160 lines of dead, fully-shadowed duplicate function
      definitions (Install-GraphifyPlatform/Hook/StrictMode,
      Invoke-GraphifyExtract, Find-GraphifySkipSemanticFlag all existed
      twice; PowerShell silently ran only the later copy).
    - Added a TLS 1.2/1.3 floor at startup for the script's own web calls,
      since a from-scratch Windows 11 install can otherwise start a
      PowerShell 5.1 session on an older default.

    v4.0.2 - flow reorganization:
    - Fixed Update-GraphifyIfNeeded, which was called from the (opt-in)
      update-check path but never defined - taking that path would have
      crashed the launcher.
    - The launcher no longer runs a blocking, unconditional `npm install -g
      npm@latest` before it even shows its title banner. That call ran on
      every single launch regardless of whether npm existed yet or whether
      you wanted an update check at all. It's now part of the same opt-in
      update-check step as everything else (Git/Node/Python/Graphify/Claude
      Code), so a normal launch is faster and the flow is consistent.
    - New -SkipUpdateCheck switch (skip the update step with no prompt) and
      the existing-but-previously-unused -ForceUpdate switch now actually
      does something (run it without prompting).
    - Both the launcher and each project window now run their setup in a
      strict dependency order - OS support, then PATH, then required tools,
      then Graphify, then Claude Code, then (optional) updates, then
      OmniRoute routing, which needs Claude Code to already be found - and
      show it as numbered steps ([1/6], [2/6], ...) so it reads like a
      checklist instead of a scroll of unlabelled sections.
    - A project window used to install Graphify, detect Claude Code, and
      run OmniRoute onboarding BEFORE checking whether the project folder
      itself was even usable - so a bad path failed only after all that
      work. Folder validation now runs first.

    v4.1.0 - companion tooling was defined but never wired in, plus fully
    headless OmniRoute onboarding:
    - Install-CompanionTooling (claude-mem, headroom, claude-code-setup,
      task-observer) existed as a function but was never called from either
      Invoke-LauncherMode or Invoke-ProjectMode - on a clean install none of
      the four ever actually installed. It's now step [5/6] in the launcher
      (after Claude Code is found, before the optional update check) and
      also runs from a standalone project window opened without the
      launcher, guarded so it's skipped once all five are recorded present.
    - Added a fifth companion tool: claude-md-management (Anthropic's own
      official plugin, same anthropics/claude-plugins-official marketplace
      as claude-code-setup). It audits CLAUDE.md quality and captures
      session learnings via /revise-claude-md - directly relevant here since
      this script already writes/merges CLAUDE.md itself.
    - claude-mem's installer is interactive by default (IDE multi-select,
      LLM-provider prompt) unless targeted with --ide. Added
      `--ide claude-code` to skip the IDE-detection prompt for the one IDE
      this launcher cares about; the existing 180s timeout is the fallback
      if a prompt still appears (it did before too - the call just used to
      spend the timeout on something that could never install).
    - Set-ProjectClaudeMdDirective now also writes a "Companion tooling"
      section (claude-mem / headroom / claude-code-setup / task-observer /
      claude-md-management, and how they coexist) alongside the existing
      Graphify section, so every project's CLAUDE.md documents the full
      toolset, not just Graphify.
    - OmniRoute's API key no longer requires a manual trip to the dashboard.
      Request-OmniRouteApiKeyAutomatically logs in headlessly against
      OmniRoute's own dashboard-session endpoint (POST /api/auth/login),
      trying a remembered password first and OmniRoute's documented
      first-run default (CHANGEME) after that, then mints a key via
      POST /api/keys using that session - matching what the bug tracker
      confirms is the same endpoint the dashboard's own "create API key"
      button calls. Only if every automatic attempt fails does it fall back
      to the original interactive Read-OmniRouteApiKey prompt, so a machine
      where the password was already changed by hand behaves exactly as
      before. The Claude Code PROVIDER connection inside OmniRoute (the
      OAuth sign-in to your actual Claude.ai account) is deliberately left
      alone - that's a real account sign-in, not something this script
      automates password entry for.
    - OmniRoute is now also registered as an MCP server for Claude Code
      itself (`claude mcp add --transport http --scope user omniroute ...`),
      once a verified key exists, so a Claude Code session can inspect and
      adjust OmniRoute's own routing/compression/quota state as tools
      instead of only ever being a client behind it.
    - Compression stays pinned to Stacked (still the strongest documented
      combo). Noted in comments only: OmniRoute issue #4268 reports Stacked
      sometimes under-reporting savings in the dashboard's analytics on real
      agent sessions even though it's compressing - if the dashboard numbers
      look flat, that's a known upstream display issue, not a sign this
      script's PUT to /api/settings/compression failed.

    v4.2.0 - robustness sweep, verified auto-compression, install
    verification, no behavioral change to what gets installed:
    - Several blocking Read-Host prompts (Start-OmniRoute's "press Enter"
      waits, Confirm-ClaudeCodeProvider's browser-signin wait, the manual
      OmniRoute API key prompt, Find-ClaudeExecutable's last-resort file
      picker) could be reached from a spawned/child project window with no
      guarantee anyone is watching it - the multi-window picker can open
      several at once. All now check $script:IsChild and skip straight to a
      warn-and-degrade path instead of blocking a window nobody may be
      looking at; the interactive launcher window is unaffected.
    - Invoke-CompleteUninstaller's "type rm to uninstall" listener used to
      run in every window, including spawned project windows - a child
      window is the wrong place to offer removing shared global tools out
      from under its sibling windows. Now launcher-only.
    - The official Claude Code installer fetch (irm https://claude.ai/
      install.ps1) had no timeout at all; a stalled download could hang the
      launcher indefinitely. Added -TimeoutSec 60.
    - Stop-Script's final "press Enter to close" wait was unbounded; it now
      gives up after 15 minutes and exits anyway, so a window nobody comes
      back to still closes instead of sitting open forever.
    - Test-ClaudeExecutable's native-binary check read the child process's
      output with a blocking, unbounded ReadToEnd() before ever applying its
      5-second WaitForExit - a hung `claude.exe --version` could block
      forever. Worse, if the version check failed OR threw, the catch block
      swallowed it and the function fell through to reporting success
      anyway ("Verified Claude binary path") purely because the file
      existed - so a broken Claude install was never actually caught. Now
      reuses Invoke-ExternalCommand (async reads, real timeout) and only
      returns true when the version check itself actually succeeded.
    - Both launcher and project-window setup now check Test-ClaudeExecutable's
      result instead of discarding it, retry via a manual path prompt
      (launcher only), and stop with exit code 103 (documented since v4.0 but
      never actually used) if Claude Code still can't be verified, rather
      than pressing on with a ClaudePath that was never confirmed to work.
    - Set-OmniRouteBestCompression now does a GET read-back after its PUT and
      retries once if the active mode doesn't match what was requested
      (OmniRoute's own issue #4268 notes success isn't always reliably
      reported). Still configures Stacked only, still uses only the
      already-saved API key, still doesn't nag after a manual dashboard
      change - but a new OmniRouteCompressionLastCheckedUtc timestamp makes
      it re-verify periodically (every 7 days) instead of trusting a single
      long-ago push forever, and -ReconfigureOmniRoute now forces an
      immediate re-check too.
    - claude-mem, claude-code-setup, claude-md-management, and headroom
      install-verification strengthened beyond "does a directory exist" /
      "did the shell command exit 0": claude-mem checks the marketplace
      directory actually has files in it, the two official plugins
      cross-check against `claude plugin list`, and headroom checks whether
      its statusline actually got wired into settings.json.

    v4.3.0 - final correctness pass: multi-window config races, dead control
    flow, resume-retry parity, and one remaining hang risk:
    - Save-Configuration's per-field merge only ever protected
      OmniRouteApiKeyEnc / OmniRouteKeyVerifiedUtc / OmniRouteProviderVerifiedUtc /
      ClaudePath / LastGraphifyVersion / MasterFolder / LastProject from being
      clobbered back to blank by a window that loaded its in-memory config
      before another window recorded one of these. OmniRouteDashboardPasswordEnc,
      OmniRouteDashboardLoginVerifiedUtc, and the new
      OmniRouteCompressionLastCheckedUtc were missing from that list - a second
      window saving config.json for an unrelated reason (adding a project to
      history, for instance) could silently erase a just-remembered dashboard
      password or reset the compression recheck clock back to blank. All three
      now get the same never-blank-over-a-value protection. The same race
      applied to every "already installed/configured" boolean
      (ClaudeMemInstalled, HeadroomInstalled, ClaudeCodeSetupPluginInstalled,
      TaskObserverInstalled, ClaudeMdManagementPluginInstalled,
      OmniRouteMcpRegistered, OmniRouteCompressionConfigured,
      FirstRunComplete) - a stale window's own not-yet-installed copy of one of
      these could overwrite another window's already-recorded success back to
      false, triggering a needless reinstall attempt on the next launch. These
      now follow the same "sticky true" rule already used for
      OmniRouteProviderPromptSuppressed: once any window's on-disk value is
      true, it stays true for every window from then on.
    - Invoke-GraphifyExtract always returns $true by design - a failed
      extraction warns and lets Claude Code start anyway, per its own inline
      comments - which made Invoke-ProjectMode's
      "if (-not (Invoke-GraphifyExtract)) { Stop-Script -Code 106 }" dead code
      that could never actually fire. Removed the unreachable check and the
      now-provably-unused exit code 106 from the documented exit-code list,
      rather than leave a control-flow branch that reads as load-bearing but
      isn't.
    - Start-ClaudeSession's "--continue failed, retry as a new session"
      recovery only existed on the native-binary launch path; the Node.js
      fallback path (used when the native install didn't complete) had no
      equivalent, so resuming a project with no prior conversation would just
      fail there instead of falling back to a new session the way the primary
      path does. Both paths now behave the same way.
    - Install-ClaudePluginsAndSkills cloned the Superpowers plugin via a raw
      `cmd /c git clone ... >nul 2>&1` with no timeout - the one remaining
      unbounded external call after the v4.2.0 timeout sweep, able to hang the
      launcher indefinitely on a stalled clone. Now goes through
      Invoke-ExternalCommand with a 60s timeout (and GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0),
      the same pattern used for every other external call in the script.
    - Read-PathWithHistory's fast-input drain (added to keep up with a pasted
      path) appended every already-buffered keystroke's raw character
      unconditionally - if Enter/Backspace/Escape/an arrow key was already
      queued behind a paste (typing or pasting a path and immediately pressing
      Enter is the common case), its control character got typed into the
      path text instead of being handled, silently corrupting the input. The
      drain now recognizes control keys and hands them back to the main loop
      instead of appending them as literal text.

    v4.3.1 - audit follow-up: a config-destroying bug, two more unguarded
    child-window prompts, and five smaller correctness fixes:
    - Set-ClaudeAvailableModels could silently wipe the user's entire shared
      ~/.claude/settings.json: on a JSON parse failure of the existing file,
      it substituted an empty object and then wrote that (plus the new
      availableModels field) back over the real file, destroying every MCP
      server registration, permission, hook, and statusline config on the
      machine - not just this launcher's. A parse failure now aborts the
      write entirely and leaves the file untouched, and a settings.json.bak
      backup is written before every successful overwrite of a file that
      actually parsed, so a bad write is always recoverable. The same
      "returns $null on parse failure, read by the caller as genuinely no
      config yet" pattern in ConvertTo-Configuration was lower blast-radius
      but the same bug class - Save-Configuration's merge would silently
      skip merging and overwrite config.json with fresh defaults on the next
      save after any transient corruption. An existing-but-unparseable
      config.json is now backed up to config.json.corrupt-<timestamp> with a
      WARN logged, distinct from the genuinely-missing case.
    - Two blocking prompts in Invoke-ProjectMode were not guarded by
      $script:IsChild, contradicting the v4.2.0 hardening pass: Show-
      GraphResult's "Open the graph now?" and the "Press Enter to launch
      Claude, or X to exit" prompt both now skip straight to their default
      (don't open / launch immediately) in a spawned project window, the
      same pattern already used everywhere else. The final "Press Enter to
      close this window" wait was also unbounded, unlike Stop-Script's
      equivalent wait - both now share a new Wait-KeyPressBounded helper
      (extracted from Stop-Script) so neither can hang a window forever.
    - Set-OmniRouteLaunchEnvironment's fallback to the blocking secure-string
      Read-OmniRouteApiKey prompt (reached when Get-OmniRouteApiKey returns
      $null, e.g. a DPAPI decrypt failure) had no $script:IsChild check,
      unlike every other missing-key path in Initialize-OmniRoute. Now warns
      and falls back to launching Claude directly (unrouted) in a child
      window instead of blocking it.
    - Install-CompanionTooling and Invoke-UpdateCheckIfRequested both printed
      [5/6], with OmniRoute setup then printing [6/6] - two steps sharing one
      number. Invoke-UpdateCheckIfRequested is opt-in and was never supposed
      to be a numbered step (the comment already said so); it no longer
      passes -Step/-TotalSteps to Write-Section.
    - Test-OmniRouteProviderViaCli aborted its whole provider scan on one
      malformed catalog entry: under Set-StrictMode, a missing .id/.name/
      .status on any single entry threw, was caught by the function's outer
      try/catch, and returned $false immediately even if a later entry was
      the actual connected provider. Each entry now gets its own try/catch
      that skips past a bad one instead of aborting the scan.
    - Install-ViaWinget/Update-ViaWinget detected success/failure from
      English-only text matches, missing on non-English-language Windows
      installs despite the existing comment already naming the locale-
      independent numeric winget codes. Both now also check $result.ExitCode
      numerically (-1978335189 for already-installed, -2147024891 /
      0x80070005 for access-denied/needs-elevation) alongside the existing
      text matching.
    - A bad-project-folder check in project-mode setup used exit code 102,
      which .NOTES documents (and Test-RequiredDependencies actually uses)
      exclusively for a missing required dependency. It now uses 106 (freed
      by the v4.3.0 cleanup) and .NOTES documents it.
    - AutoUpdateGraphify was defined in Get-DefaultConfiguration but never
      read anywhere. Wired in: when true, Invoke-UpdateCheckIfRequested now
      runs Update-GraphifyIfNeeded even if the general interactive update
      check is declined or skipped via -SkipUpdateCheck, since it's a
      standing "auto-do this" toggle rather than a "did we already do this"
      marker like most of this config's other flags.
    v4.3.2 - live-run hotfix: the 'n' (new project folder) picker key threw
    an unhandled "The property 'Count' cannot be found on this object" and
    crashed the launcher (exit code 99) the first time a typed folder name
    produced zero or exactly one invalid-character match. New-ProjectFolder's
    validation checked `($name.ToCharArray() | Where-Object {...}).Count` -
    when that pipeline matches 0 or 1 characters, PowerShell unwraps the
    result to $null or a bare [char] rather than an array, and neither has a
    .Count property under Set-StrictMode. Wrapped in @(...) to force a real
    array, matching every other .Count check already in the file (a repo-
    wide grep for the same unwrapped-pipeline-.Count pattern found this was
    the only remaining instance).

    v4.3.3 - live-run hotfix: choosing a single project number or 'm' (open
    the master folder) in the picker silently did nothing and just redrew
    the same menu. Select-Projects returned single-path results as `return
    @($path)` - but PowerShell enumerates any array written to a function's
    output stream, so a ONE-element array collapses right back down to a
    bare string by the time the caller receives it (multi-path results with
    2+ entries were unaffected, which is why 'a' and "1,3,7" already worked).
    Invoke-LauncherMode's picker loop then saw what looked like a plain
    string, didn't match it against 'q'/'c'/'n', and fell through to
    `continue` - redrawing the menu instead of opening anything. Fixed by
    changing the three affected `return @(...)` statements (the 'm' case,
    the 'a' case, and the final numbered-selection case) to `return
    ,@(...)` - the leading comma wraps the array in one more layer so
    enumeration only ever unwraps down to the intended array, never past it,
    regardless of how many paths it holds.

# COMPANION TOOLING
#   Five Claude Code companions installed once at USER scope (not per
#   project), so every project window gets all five automatically with no
#   per-project install step and no per-tool on/off switch:
#     - claude-mem          persistent cross-session memory (plugin)
#     - headroom            context-window usage bar in the statusline
#     - claude-code-setup   official Anthropic plugin that scans a project
#                           and recommends tailored MCP servers/skills/hooks
#     - task-observer       skill that logs workflow friction for later review
#     - claude-md-management official Anthropic plugin that audits and
#                           maintains CLAUDE.md itself (quality checks,
#                           /revise-claude-md to capture session learnings)
#   Each is independently best-effort: a failed install warns and moves on,
#   the same way a failed Graphify hook install does elsewhere in this
#   script, rather than stopping the whole launch over an add-on. Wired in
#   via Install-CompanionTooling below, called from both Invoke-LauncherMode
#   and (as a fallback) Invoke-ProjectMode.

#   inside OmniRoute itself, via one of its named modes (Off/Lite/Standard/
#   Aggressive/Ultra/RTK/Stacked). Set-OmniRouteBestCompression below pushes
#   every project onto Stacked - the strongest documented combo, RTK's
#   command/tool-output filtering feeding into Caveman's filler-removal
#   pass on what's left, for a documented ~78-95% eligible-token range.
#
#   Per OmniRoute's own Claude Code guide:
#     ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL     gateway root, NO /v1 suffix
#     ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN   sent as Authorization: Bearer ...; wins over

# API KEY STORAGE AND VALIDATION
#
# The v3 behaviour that sent you back through onboarding on every launch had
# two causes, both fixed here:
#   1. The only "is this set up?" probe was `omniroute providers list --json`.
#      If that subcommand was missing, renamed, slow, or printed anything
#      unparseable, the answer read as "not connected" and the dashboard was
#      opened again.
#   2. Nothing was ever recorded once setup HAD succeeded, so there was no
#      memory to consult on the next run.
# Now: a saved key is trusted unless OmniRoute actively rejects it (401/403),
# an unreachable server never discards it, and both "key works" and "Claude
# provider is connected" are written to config.json the first time they're
# observed and short-circuit every later launch.

# endpoint the dashboard's own login form submits to, and it mints a 30-day
# session JWT in an auth_token cookie. POST /api/keys, with that cookie
# attached, is the same endpoint the dashboard's "create API key" button
# calls (confirmed independently by an OmniRoute issue report: "create an
# API key (or create via POST /api/keys)"). Chaining the two headlessly is
# exactly what a person clicking through the dashboard would produce - this
# isn't a bypass of anything, it's the same two HTTP calls without the UI.
#
# This is ONLY for OmniRoute's own local admin login (its default first-run
# password, which OmniRoute's own login screen prints as "CHANGEME" unless

# 1M-CONTEXT MODEL RESOLUTION
#
# Claude Opus 5 (`claude-opus-5`) and Claude Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) each
# carry a 1M-token context window as BOTH the default and the maximum, and
# Anthropic's model docs are explicit that there is no smaller context variant
# of either. That means:
#   - there is no separate "-1m" / "[1m]" model ID to hunt for on the -5
#     models the way there was on the 4.x generation, and
#   - v3's `claude-sonnet-5(?!.*1m)` pattern was excluding a variant that does
#     not exist, while v3's literal-only `claude-opus-5` match meant Opus
#     silently never appeared at all.
# So: a -5 model is accepted as 1M on sight. Anything else is accepted only if
# the catalog itself reports a >=1M window (this is the escape hatch for an
# explicitly long-context 4.x entry). Nothing shorter is ever pinned.
#
# Provider prefix: OmniRoute serves Claude-family models under `cc/` (its
# Claude Code OAuth provider). Unprefixed `claude-*` IDs can come back as
# "Ambiguous model ..." when more than one connected provider exposes the same
# Claude model, so the prefixed form is preferred for the env-var pins, which
# accept any ID. The bare form is kept as a fallback.

CRITICAL: You must run ``graphify query`` or read ``graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`` (or ``.graphify/graph.json`` / ``.graphify/studio/studio.html`` on newer Graphify builds) before any raw file read, Glob, or Grep. This is non-negotiable.

$markerHeading

- Treat ``graphify`` as mandatory for understanding this codebase. ``grep``/``Grep`` and raw file reads are a fallback only, to be used after consulting the graph, never before it.
- Any subagent spawned inside this project must follow the same rule: query the graph first, fall back to grep only if the graph doesn't have the answer.
- At the start of a session: use ``graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`` (or the current project's ``.graphify/graph.json``) before searching files. Do not use raw grep first.
- Strict-mode enforcement is active for this project (``graphify install --project --strict``, ``GRAPHIFY_HOOK_STRICT=1``, and a ``PreToolUse`` hook installed via ``graphify claude install`` in ``.claude/settings.json``). The first raw source read of a session is hard-blocked and redirected to the graph; file search and bash commands are intercepted by the hook.

$companionMarkerHeading

The following are installed once at user scope (``~/.claude/``) and are active in every session in this project, not just this one. They don't overlap or need to be invoked manually - each reacts to its own lifecycle hook or slash command:

- **claude-mem** - captures what happens in this session (files read/edited, decisions made) and injects relevant memories back in at the start of future sessions. Nothing to do here; it runs on Claude Code's own SessionStart/PostToolUse/Stop hooks.
- **headroom** - a live context-window usage bar in the statusline, reading the actual session JSONL rather than estimating. Purely observational - use it to decide when to ``/compact`` or start a fresh session, especially important on a long OmniRoute-routed session where compression changes what "context used" looks like.
- **claude-code-setup** - read-only; if asked to recommend MCP servers, hooks, skills, or subagents for this project, this is the mechanism, invoked via its own skill.
- **task-observer** - a skill for spotting when an existing skill in this project is out of date or missing something, based on how it's actually being used.
- **claude-md-management** - this file. Run ``/revise-claude-md`` (or press ``#`` mid-session) to capture a learning - a discovered build flag, a naming convention you were corrected on - directly into this file instead of losing it at session end. Keep additions concise and merged into the relevant existing section rather than appended as a new one where one already fits.
